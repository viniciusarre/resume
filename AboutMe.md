# About me

I was born in [Fernandópolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernand%C3%B3polis), São Paulo, which is a small town in the countryside of the state of São Paulo, Brazil.

From an early age, I have developed an interest for music, hence I grew up playing in [OSFER](http://osfer.com.br/2015/home-en). Music was a good part of my childhood and adolescence. I have played many musical instruments, including the guitar, the French Horn and the Trumpet.

Later in my adolescence, I developed an interest in learning foreign languages and discovering other cultures. It all started by the time I was 15 years old, as I began teaching myself English.
I have been fascinated by how the internet could easily connect me to the world and meeting new people and realities quickly became a good part of my life, as I was heading into adulthood. I have learned and can still communicate / read in the following foreign languages: English, Spanish, French and Italian.]

Also, during these years, I have developed an interest in writing fiction. Having had an idea for a science-fiction book (which hasn't been written yet), as well as poems, short stories (from which I have published two in anthologies in Brazil).

By the time I was 19, however, I started my career in Web Development by joining a university course in a nearby city. My efforts and dedication helped me achieve an opportunity to study abroad in Chile.
And, later on, I have been lucky enough to combine my passion of discovering the world and different cultures to work as a Web Developer by freelancing with clients from several foreign countries.

Now, besides working on personal projects and learning new technologies, I enjoy focusing on the same things I used to before: I have been playing the bass guitar, reading about philosophy and science in foreign languages, as well as learning some Japanese.
