# About me

I was born in [Fernandópolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernand%C3%B3polis), a small town in the countryside of the state of São Paulo, Brazil.

I am a full-stack web developer with an interest on writing educational and/or open-source systems. I have mostly been working with JavaScript, but I have also done some projects using Python and I have an interest in Rust.

My main skills are:

**Proficient in**: HTML/ CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Redux.js, Vue.js, GraphQL, MongoDB, Python, Unix Shell, Git, CI/CD, SQL Databases (Postgres and mySQL), . 

**Familiar with**: Rust, React-Native, OOP-Programming (PHP and Java), MS-DOS.

**Soft-Skills**: 

**Communicative about requirements and client-driven:** When working with clients from different backgrounds and countries, it is important to be mindful about communication.

I always keep in mind how SCRUM clearly states the importance of 5 values to success in Team Work (Commitment; Focus; Openness; Respect and Courage)

**Languages:**

I am very interested in learning about new languages and cultures, which have led me to learn the following languages:

* **Native language**: **Portuguese;
* **Fluent in:** English and Spanish;
* **Advanced-level:** French;
* **Intermediate-level:** Italian;
* **Currently learning:** Japanese.
