## Open Source

I am a big fan of contributing to Open Source projects seasonally. I have been working on my own Open Source projects. They're basically small-sized personal projects and POCs I want to get developed and out there. There's a list of these projects below:

* **Quote-a-Lang**: This is a really fun project I have been working on since my exchange program. The idea consists of creating a language-practicing app using quotes from WikiQuotes. So far, I have implemented a small Proof of Concept API using Node.js, Express and MongoDB. I have been working on the client-side now and on improving the tests. It also uses a Python web crawling server to fetch the quotes from the web page. In the future, I plan on implement a Spaced-Repetition System. 
  
    You can learn more about it here: [API](https://github.com/viniciusarre/quote-a-lang-server) and [Web Crawler](https://github.com/viniciusarre/quote-a-lang-crawler).

* **Rust Playground**: This is a small repository in which I do some testing with Rust, as I have been studying it lately. There isn't anything too complex, but it might help you grasp the syntax if you're new to the language.

* **Star Wars Portfolio**: This is a project I have worked on in university. It is quite simple, as it contains information about the subjects, but in a Star-Wars aesthetic. I will definitely revisit it soon.
