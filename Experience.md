### Work Experience

##### Freelance Full-Stack Web Developer at Upwork (August 2018 - Present)

I have been helping clients from several countries build and improve their Web Systems in a communicative, client-first driven environment. I am a part of the platform's Top Rated program, with 100% Job Success. Below, you can find some of the projects I have worked on (in a long-term basis):

* **Taskeo** (From August 2018 until March 2019): this was the first project I landed on the platform, I worked on it as a Full-Stack Web developer using React, Redux, Node.js, Express and MongoDB. It was a very interesting project, since it taught me more about the inner workings of a start-up project work and how they're developed in a customer-first approach. 
  
* **SportsLog IronMan** (From March 2019 until June 2019): this was a very interesting project, as I could build a Sports Management System for the IronMan Triathlon competition which took place in Florian√≥polis in the same year. It was built using React, Redux, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

* **Karufuka** (From July 2019 until November 2019): this is an HR management system startup which is an important project for the Japanese market, by helping Japanese companies hire and manage their openings and applications. In this project, I had the opportunity to explore new technologies, as the project was built using Vue.js/Nuxt.js, GraphQL/Apollo, Node.js and PostgreSQL. 

* **EdEHR** (Since December 2019): This is a very interesting project I have been working on, since it is helping me shape my interests in working both on an Open Source Project, as well as on an educational system. It is a Canadian student-focused electronic health record system, which aims to provide students a simple way to simulate case studies, which is being built using Vue.js, Node.js and MongoDB.
